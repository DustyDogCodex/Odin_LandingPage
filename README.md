This is the Landing Page project from The Odin Project.

My goal was to create a landing page for a website! 

Completed Project Update!

Finished the landing page! Used placeholders for the small images in the random information section. The webiste is flexible and should work and display well on a variety of display sizes. Did not add responsiveness for mobile since the project didn't call for it. 

The finished project looks like a fantastic landing page for a small business or a single page application. There is space to add more text and images, as well as a small section for customer testimonials/reviews.

Through this project I learned: 
1) How to design a webpage from scratch using HTML/CSS.
2) Working with flexbox to add natural responsiveness to a webpage.
3) Commiting to and hosting my code on GitHub.
4) Creating a repo for a project on GitHub and actively updating it.
5) Hosting a webpage using Github Pages.
