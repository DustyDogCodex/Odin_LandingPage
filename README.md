# Odin_LandingPage
Landing Page project from The Odin Project.

My aim is to create a landing page for a website! It will have four sections plus a header and footer. The sections will have some text in them but also act as placeholders for more text or images!

Completed Project Update!

Finished the landing page! Used placeholders for the small images in the random information section. The webiste is flexible and should work and display well on a variety of display sizes. Did not add responsiveness for mobile since the project didn't specicifically call for it. 

The finished project looks like a fantastic landing page for a webiste that can also link to other pages on the webiste or even externally. There is space to add more text and images, as well as a small section for quotes or customer testimonials/reviews.
